# Battleship
Hello, Battleship was my final project for CSC 201. We were prompted to incorporate Object-Oriented concepts, in addition, to what we've learned throughout the semester.

This game is a GUI which can be played by running the BattleshipDriver.java file As you will notice, the game has only one ship per category. After you've placed your ships, press "Continue" and play the game. Each time you miss, the bot will make their move. However, the bot is not smart enough to calculate where to fire next so it'll shoot randomly, but never at the same spot. I have not concluded this program with a winning screen, but may intend to do so in the future. Thanks!
